WARNING: This story contains details some readers may find distressing.

Before the first electromagnetic waves from any radar device surveying a suspected residential school grave site penetrate the ground, archeologists have likely already gathered key information from one of their most important sources: survivors.

Survivors will either have heard stories over the years or have direct knowledge of the site itself, said Terence Clark, an assistant professor of archeology at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. "We've heard that often, children would be the ones digging the graves for other children, and so they might know exactly where the graves are," he said. "It's not realistic to do hundreds of metres around schools in every direction. It's kind of a needle in a haystack. But if we can talk to survivors that know specific information, then we can certainly narrow down our search."
Understanding the process and technology of detecting unmarked graves has become a focus following the shocking announcement by the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation last week. It said that preliminary findings from a survey of the grounds at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School indicate that the remains of 215 children could be buried at the site.

That determination was made by a specialist who used ground-penetrating radar (GPR), a geophysical survey method to examine the site. It's technology that is often used on sites to determine the presence of underground conduits, water pipes and gas and sewer lines. But it also can be used to scan historic cemeteries and unmarked graves.

On Friday, Kukpi7 (Chief) Rosanne Casimir  said they expect to have a final report at the end of the month about the survey findings at the former residential school.

'It's a very heavy process'
"When you're actually walking across these grounds, I like to say that it's a very heavy process," Kisha Supernant, an associate professor at the University of Alberta's department of anthropology, told CBC Radio's Day 6.
